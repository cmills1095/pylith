# Step 5: Spontaneous Rupture Driven by Subducting Slab

This example is not yet complete.
The parameters need to be fine tuned to produce the desired behavior and improve the convergence for the nonlinear solve.
See Steps 5 and 6 in Section {numref}`sec:example:subduction:2d` for a 2-D example.
